---------------

Personal:

- 2012 get together
- 2017 start dancing partnership together
- planning to have kids and continue dancing.
- already found how to deal with difficulties.
- initially decided not to work together. Relationship/Love vs Partnership. Didn't want the work to come in first place before partnership. But then decided to try by agreeing relationship first, partnership second.
- Got better at organization. Taking quality time for themselves while traveling.

---------------

What do you do outside of dancing?

- gym, diet, prepare bodies for what is coming
- preparing online classes, some Zoom coaching
- hobbies: hashisha smoking, cooperative video games.

---------------

Dancing scene in Lisbon, Portugal

- rather small
- Lucas & Thayna
- Pilo and Mathalda?
- in Porto: lido and monique
- supporting each other.
- expecting in the short future to get better.

---------------

How did you come up with the BRIC methodology?

- Bruno didn't like the way he learnt, took a lot of time. And few things.
- Traveling alone and working with many followrs. Need to teach something universal.
- Studying a lot the biomechanichs.
- Making closer to the roots of Zouk.
- Dynamics.
- They put on paper how to start.
- Break into small pieces and teach how to connect them.

- Level 1 recommended after 2 years experience, nurdy course. 
- Level 1 to 3 for students. Level 4 to 5 for teachers.
- Level 1 to 3 are missing some things that have special editions on specific topics. E.g. connection, musicality.

- Level 1 is followers based for followers and leaders. Both depend on each other and need to understand each other.

---------------

How do you see the current Zouk scene?

- There are society boundaries that people do not consider while dancing, e.g. intimacy. For example having an errection while dancing.
- Bruno doesn't like bringing external practices into Zouk, like tantra. People might not be ready. Need an agreement. Lot of people getting into traumatic situations.
- Socks and barefoot dangerous when dancing in an environment with people with shoes. Safety first.
- J&J competition: do not let the score define you.
- Wish: dancers to go into classes according to levels.

---------------

Queuing to dance with stars

- not liking when people deny dances to other people in order to remain in the queue.

- they are not paid for social dancing, they want to have fun and freedom to dance socials. Don't want to have an obligation.

Teaching vs social dancing vs performing shows
