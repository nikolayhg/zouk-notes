----------------------------------
- Personal.
  - 2004 started dancing
  - 2006 joins the "Jaimerusha?" dance studio and became bolsista (scholarship student)
  - Zouk as a hobby for 10-12 years constantly taking classes, every week at least one class and socials. Primary dances were Bolero, Samba de Gafieira, Tango.
  - Worked as a lawyer in Brazil
  - 2017 relocates to Washington (US) from Rio (Brazil) and started helping the local Zouk community with teaching.
----------------------------------
- What do you love about dancing?
  - In the beginning find a community, then a way to relate/connect with girls, then have fun. Joy of moving, moving together with someone, moving with music. Bring people in different ages. Friends everywhere in the world.
----------------------------------
- How did he overcome shyness?
  - By more confidence. Forced to talk/explain dancing. Studying about public speaking.
----------------------------------
- First impression as a Brazilian watching US Zouk dancers: people are too far away from each other. The cultural difference. Hard for people to get into close embrace. Created the workshops "The universe behind the hug", then teaching fundamentals and variations, then teaching leader's training. 
- Currently over 100 students during the week in physical classes, around 60 people online. Updating the curriculum so more easily learn Zouk.
----------------------------------
- One of the barriers to learn Zouk - difficult to learn. New approach: make it easier. E.g. new way to teach Bonus (skip twisted turn and the patinha, focus on the flow and feeling of the whole move), also for traveling turn and basic.
- Make it easier for people to dance, embrace their WHYs for dancing. Those who want more technique, they will find ways.
- Some people dance in order to connect to other people. Others just to relax and follow.
- What are the minimum things needed for social dancing?
----------------------------------
The embrace:
- physical: 
  - understand well walking and weight transfer, and how to adapt to the partner, step with the partner, stay around their point of balance. Needed to become sensitive to movement.
  - how to embrace? what are hands, arms doing, how to position your chest, neck.
  - feeling of comfort.
- mind:
  - no desire for particular movements, always adapting to current reality, don't try to correct the other, adapt. No ideal follower, rather embracing all the things the follower can do with me.
  - Once he arrived to the belief "Only these 3 followers can understand and follow me" he didn't enjoy dancing anymore. Because he was too picky. Having fun only with the person that could follow him. He needed to change WHY he was dancing. For the joy of moving and then he changed to finding the joy with more people by doing less. The dance will develop depending on the person he was dancing with. Meeting the follower where they were. Musicality helped him.
- shortly: weight transfers + mindset.
----------------------------------
Two dance epiphanies in Buenos Aires
- Tango in Brazil felt too hard, so he went to the source, Argentina.
- First class. Sees a lady, shorter than him, grey hair, round body. He took a side step with her, forward cross and it was like dancing with the wind. For his beginner's brain that didn't make any sense at all. He was judging her for her shape and age. How can this body produce this thing?
- In another social, another lady comes in. Taller lady, looks ugly, "she might not get any dance" he thought. Then she doesn't stop dancing, people keep inviting her a lot. Gui Prada gets curious, invites her for to dance, and the moment she puts her arms around him, he had his 2nd dance epiphany, and suddenly she became the most beautiful goddess alive to him. How is this possible? He could't understand. Her arms were just around him.
  - Recently he felt the same with a Tango instructor in the US. And he told her "dancing with you I feel like I am the last man alive". She replies "because in that moment you are". Mindset.
----------------------------------
- People trying too hard to achieve certain look or technique. When trying less hard, people unlock something and enjoy the dance more. Teach people the feel of the movement, not necessary the movement. How does this movement feel like? The followers can give feedback to the leaders how the movement feels to them. What they like in the movement? What feels good in my body while doing the movement?
----------------------------------
Gui Prada's goals with Zouk
- For the local scene: the grow enough in numbers and people to be for the joy of it. Initially they wanted to develop great dancers, later realized this was very narrow goal. Then changed to develop competent dancers, for people to have great time at socials. This changed the way they talked, teach, etc. What is the spirit of the scene? And as a subgoal: for the great dancers (the beasts) but also for them to be happy dance basics the whole night. They become reference points that showcase what the vibe of the scene is.
- The more developed the scene is, the less you see the instructors participating in the social dancing. They would sit, talk more. Gui's desire: not to be needed during the socials.
- 200-300 Zouk dancers as a goal for the local scene.

ZoukNerds Facebook Group https://www.facebook.com/groups/zouknerds
- Allison Sandi invited Gui. Alisson did 90% of the work.
- Main intention: people can hear from the prominent Zouk instructors, organizers and community leaders. Currently this is on hold.
- Currently the members of the group keep it alive.
- most active Zouk FB group.
----------------------------------
Where do you see Zouk going?
- Zouk as other dances is cyclical. Currently Zouk is reconnecting with Lambada, the dance is becoming big again, as movements, the younger generation from Sao Paolo, explosions, spins. 5 years ago we were in a different phase. Not enjoying, then slowing down and enjoying more. Now the phase is doing more. Expecting to cycle back into doing less and find its identity a bit more.
- Zouk is still young, from the late 80s.
----------------------------------
He is really interested into how people teach. Just be present and absorb.
